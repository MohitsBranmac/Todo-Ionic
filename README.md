Todo Application
=================

A Simple Todo Application made with Ionic 3.0 framework and Angular 5.0
------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple application made by Hybrid Mobile frameowrk called Ionic 3.0 and JavaScript Framework Angular 5.0 and @angular-cli. This single codebase would work for all major platforms including Windows. For further info on Ionic framework, visit this [link](https://ionicframework.com/).

In order to work with Ionic framework, you'll need to install **angular-cli** on your machine. Follow the following steps to install angular-cli to your machine:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

For Further information on **angular-cli**, visit official webpage of [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/). To confirm the installation of angular-cli, try `ng --version` in your terminal. Now, the next step would be to install **ionic-cli**. Ionic-cli comes with pre-configured SDKs for devlopment in Android, iOS and Windows. Follow the steps to install Ionic on your machine:

`npm install -g cordova ionic`

A side note: cordova installation is needed to access the native functionalities.

* Generate new ionic project

`ionic start myApp`

The above command will generate a project named myApp for ya.

* fire the dev server

`ionic serve`

The above command will fire the dev server and serve the virtual app and templates right in your browser. One thing to notice here is that Ionic starts out with a blank app. And of-course you can generate different templates like tabs etc,. To achieve that just give the argument to the cli, say you want your starter template with tabs, so try the following in your terminal `ionic start myApp tabs`. And the followng command generate all the necessary templates

* Alernate to ionic serve

`ionic lab`

For further information, visit the [official documentation](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) of ionic cli and Ionic.

Clone the project and fire the dev server with `ionic lab`. Happy Coding! :v: :raised-hands:
